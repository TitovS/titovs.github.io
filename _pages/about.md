Hello! My name is Timofey, and I am the Head of [JetBrains Research](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/). From 2016 to 2024, I was leading the Laboratory of Machine Learning Methods in Software Engineering at JetBrains Research.

I graduated summa cum laude from [Saint Petersburg State University](https://english.spbu.ru/), Department of Software Engineering, in 2007. I defended my PhD thesis on a _Software platform for the creation of domain-specific visual development environments_ at Saint Petersburg State University in 2016.

I also taught classes in the following universities:
* From 2008 to 2022: senior lecturer and associate professor at [Saint Petersburg State University](https://english.spbu.ru/)
* From 2018 to 2022: associate professor at [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/)
* From 2023: adjunct professor at [Constructor University](https://constructor.university/)

My general research interests include:
* Software development tools and processes
* Tools for automated code analysis
* Applications of machine learning methods in software engineering

On this website, you can find the list of my [publications](https://jzuken.github.io/publications/), practical [tools](https://jzuken.github.io/tools/) developed under my supervision, my [academic and educational work](https://jzuken.github.io/academic_work/), as well as the recordings of my [talks](https://jzuken.github.io/talks/) at various conferences.
