Hello! My name is Sergey, and I am the Head of the Code Modeling Research team at [JetBrains Research](https://lp.jetbrains.com/research/software-engineering/). 
I joined JetBrains as Junior Researcher in 2020, became Researcher in 2022, Senior Researcher in 2024, and since 2025 I am lucky to lead an amazing research team working on code modeling and code generation.
Before JetBrains, I worked as a Data Scientist in fintech, applying ML models to macroeconomic indicators.

My educational background is in psychology and philosophy, and I always strived to combine humanities and technical fields.
I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from [Saint Petersburg State University](https://english.spbu.ru/) in 2014 and a Master's degree in Complex Systems from the same university in 2016.
From 2016 to 2020, I pursued a PhD in Philosophy at the [State Academic University For The Humanities](https://gaugn.ru/en/), focusing on data science and scientific explanation, however, I did not finish it.

On this website, you can find the list of my [publications](https://titovs.github.io/publications/) and my [academic and educational work](https://titovs.github.io/academic_work/), including the classes I taught.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:timofey.bryksin[at]jetbrains.com) if you want to collaborate!
