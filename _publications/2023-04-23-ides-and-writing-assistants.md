abstract: "<p><b>Abstract</b>. With the development of artificial intelligence, writing assistants (WAs) are changing the way people interact with text, creating lengthy outputs that can be overwhelming for users. The programming field has long addressed this issue, and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have been created for efficient software development, helping programmers reduce the cognitive load. This experience could be employed in the development of WAs. IDEs can also be used to test assumptions about interventions that help people interact with WAs efficiently. Previous works have successfully used self-written IDE plugins to test hypotheses in the field of human-computer interaction. The lessons learned can be applied to the building of WAs.</p>"
