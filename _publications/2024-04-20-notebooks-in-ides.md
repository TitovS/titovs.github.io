abstract: "<p><b>Abstract</b>. In this paper, we outline potential ways for the further development of computational notebooks in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). We discuss notebooks integration with IDEs, focusing on three main areas: facilitating experimentation, adding collaborative features, and improving code comprehension. We propose that better support of notebooks will not only benefit the notebooks, but also enhance IDEs by supporting new development processes native to notebooks. In conclusion, we suggest that adapting IDEs for more experimentation-oriented notebook processes will prepare them for the future of AI-powered programming.</p>"
